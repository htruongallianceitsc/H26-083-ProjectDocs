# Production Project Documentation Starter Kit v5.5

Documentation-first starter kit for long-lived Web, Mobile and API projects. v5.5 turns the v5.4 source workspace into a local project knowledge runtime by hardening entity identity/relations, adding source and Git intelligence, and adding fast local search/query/context/doctor commands.

## What v5.5 adds

### 1. Hardened entity and relation model

- Permanent UUID `uid` for machine identity.
- Local semantic `revision` for governed edits.
- Explicit `initialStatus`, lifecycle transitions and terminal statuses for all 32 entity types.
- Semantic relation metadata with exact-rule precedence, min/max cardinality, unresolved-target policy and compatibility fallbacks.
- `entity:identity-backfill` for legacy Markdown entities.
- `entity:transition` for lifecycle-safe status changes.

### 2. Source intelligence and Git impact

- `registry/source-intelligence.json` defines scan and mapping behavior.
- `.project-docs/indexes/source-index.json` is a disposable derived source index.
- Lightweight symbol/import/dependency/dependent extraction.
- Source file -> entity evidence through application roots, explicit mappings, entity-code mentions and technical identifiers.
- `source:map` explains why a file maps to an entity.
- `git:status` and `git:impact` map changed files into graph-based potential impact.

### 3. Local knowledge engine and Doctor

- Rebuildable entity/relation/search indexes under `.project-docs/indexes/`.
- Full-text `search` across metadata and document bodies.
- Field-aware `query` with boolean expressions and graph scope.
- Bounded `context` packs that combine project graph and source evidence for AI agents.
- Reusable views in `registry/views.json`.
- `doctor` detects identity, relation and stale-index problems; `doctor --fix` performs safe derived-state repairs.

## v5.4 capabilities retained

- Progressive Specification: Lightweight / Standard / Full.
- Application entities and governed source roots.
- Versioned Source Bases for React SPA, Next.js, React Native/Expo, Flutter/BLoC, iOS/SwiftUI and Android/Compose.
- Capability Packs, Pattern Packs and reuse governance.
- Request -> Ready Gate -> reviewed WorkPlan -> Task workflow.
- Documentation freshness, impact analysis, ChangeSets and Baselines.
- Static offline documentation site and CI-ready QA.

## Start

```bash
cd tools
npm ci
npm run qa
```

For an existing project, backfill permanent entity identities once:

```bash
npm run entity:identity-backfill
npm run entity:identity-backfill -- --apply
```

Then build local engineering intelligence:

```bash
npm run source:scan
npm run knowledge:reindex
npm run doctor
```

Typical discovery commands:

```bash
npm run search -- --text "reset password"
npm run query -- --expr "type=feature AND status=in_progress"
npm run context -- --entity FEAT-AUTH-LOGIN
npm run source:map -- --entity FEAT-AUTH-LOGIN
npm run git:impact
```

## Sources of truth

- Markdown project entities in `docs/` remain canonical business/project knowledge.
- Real implementation under `apps/`, `packages/`, `tests/` and adopted source roots remains canonical source code.
- Registry JSON files define model and governance behavior.
- Files under `.project-docs/indexes/`, `.project-docs/reports/`, `docs/_generated/` and `site/` are derived and rebuildable.

See `docs/history/V5_5_UPGRADE_NOTES.md`, `standards/entity-identity-lifecycle-and-relations.md`, `standards/source-intelligence.md`, and `standards/local-knowledge-engine.md`.
